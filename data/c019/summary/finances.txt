The gross margin percentage also saw a positive progression, starting at 36.6% in Q1 2020 and reaching 46.4% in Q4 2024. However, the company experienced operating losses in the initial quarters of 2020, with operating income only turning positive in Q2 2021.

## Operating Expenses and Investment##

Operating expenses (OPEX) have shown a steady increase over the periods, from $7,200,000 in Q1 2020 to $15,500,000 in Q4 2024. This increase is partly driven by rising research and development (R&D) expenses, which grew from $3,000,000 in Q1 2020 to $6,000,000 in Q4 2024, and selling expenses, which increased from $2,400,000 to $7,000,000 over the same period. Administrative expenses remained relatively stable, ranging between $1,800,000 and $2,500,000.

This has led to a substantial increase in shareholders' equity, from $11,400,000 in Q1 2020 to $24,400,000 in Q4 2024. Free cash flow has been inconsistent, starting negative in 2020 and early 2021, but turning positive and growing to $2,800,000 by Q4 2024.
