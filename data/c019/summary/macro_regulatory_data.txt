##Technology and Product Development##
In August 2020, advancements in heliostat technology were made, specifically improving their positioning for higher efficiency. This innovation was part of a broader global trend in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) innovation and led to R&D scale-up efforts. Further product development occurred in November 2022 with the launch of a solution addressing the need for night-time solar power, which was designed to enhance adoption. This launch was in response to a global demand for long-duration energy storage and represented a diversification of the product offerings.

##Market Expansion and Strategic Partnerships##
October 2021 saw the company secure entry into the European market through a CSP pilot project, driven by the EU's solar initiatives and the EU Green Deal. This was facilitated by EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) agreements. A significant strategic move was made in July 2023 with a partnership in Saudi Arabia, aimed at diversifying the country's energy sector and opening up the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. This was supported by the Saudi Vision 2030 and involved establishing a strategic joint venture. Looking ahead to February 2025, the company is set to expand its global utility partnerships, with a joint venture aimed at enhancing its portfolio and capitalizing on international clean energy growth, further expanding its EPC portfolio.

##Risk Management and Resolution##
The company faced a risk in February 2024 due to water scarcity impacting operations at a plant, leading to delays. This issue was particularly relevant given the arid climate of the MENA region and necessitated an engineering redesign to mitigate the problem. The resolution came in September 2024 with the successful deployment of dry cooling technology, which addressed concerns about water shortages. This development aligns with a global focus on water-saving energy solutions, and a new system was implemented to overcome the challenges.

##Financial Performance and Outlook##
The company is experiencing strong solar uptake, as evidenced by record EPC bookings in August 2025. This positive financial trend is occurring against a backdrop of a global surge in renewables and is contributing to earnings momentum.
