In early 2020, Cobalt began by launching SentinelMesh, a zero-trust solution that generated excitement for its innovation, though users questioned its scalability in large enterprises. This was followed by news of Cobalt securing $18 million in Series A funding to expand its Security Operations Center (SOC), a move seen positively in a competitive market. Professional networks acknowledged internal stability with the promotion of Jamal Carter to President, supporting a global expansion push. Discussions on Reddit applauded Cobalt's technological advancements, particularly new micro-segmentation patents, but also debated their enforceability. The company later announced a significant $75 million Series B funding round, aiming to dominate the zero-trust market, which garnered high excitement with some concerns about valuation. Cobalt further strengthened its intellectual property by filing 12 zero-trust patents, enhancing its competitive edge, especially in the context of post-quantum security. The company also secured a contract with Medisafe Health, showcasing success in the healthcare sector with its zero-trust approach. Integration with SecureLogix for hardware security modules (HSM) for post-quantum readiness was highlighted as a forward-thinking development. Cobalt's annual threat report predicted a rise in ransomware, leading to a 15% increase in leads, and the company began scaling its operations by hiring 50 analysts to meet demand. Furthermore, achieving PCI-DSS Level 1 certification opened up payment markets, and a post-Series B roadshow attracted further venture capital interest. Improvements to their XDR solution, v2, were noted for reducing false positives by 30%, leading to a better user experience. Cobalt also demonstrated thought leadership at Black Hat with a keynote on zero-trust.
