## Early Technological Milestones##

The company demonstrated early technological promise with the demo of VOLTMAX in July 2020, generating enthusiasm and early optimism in its tech potential. This was followed by a significant validation of their approach with a utility pilot win in September 2021, which was seen as encouraging for customer adoption.

## Commercialization and Expansion##

The company moved into commercialization with the launch of their FlowCell X product in November 2022, which was viewed as a strategic diversification. Their credibility was further solidified in June 2023 through a contract with PG&E, a major win that excited the market.

## Operational Challenges and Recovery##

In February 2024, concerns arose due to supply chain issues, specifically a cathode shortage leading to delays, which worried investors regarding operational risk. However, by September 2024, these supply chain issues were resolved, restoring supply stability and leading to a return of stakeholder confidence.

## Strategic Partnerships and Financial Performance##

Looking ahead, the company announced a joint venture with EcoFlow & StratoSky in February 2025, a strategic integration that garnered positive attention. This was followed by a strong financial performance in August 2025, with record earnings that beat consensus, resulting in strongly positive investor sentiment.
