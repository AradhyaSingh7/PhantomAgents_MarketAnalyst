## Company Performance and Revenue Growth
TerraVolt has demonstrated consistent revenue growth from 2020 to 2024. Starting with $48.5 million in revenue in 2020, the company saw its revenue climb to $65.2 million in 2021, $89.3 million in 2022, $116.7 million in 2023, and $139.5 million in 2024. This growth trajectory was bolstered by securing its first utility pilot contracts in 2021, the commercial launch of its FlowCell X system in 2022, and a significant $50 million contract with PG&E in 2023. Despite experiencing temporary supply delays in Q1 2024, mitigation strategies were implemented, restoring resilience by the end of the year. The company also reported a record-breaking Q2 2025, with revenues of $38.1 million and a net income of $7.6 million, leading to an increase in full-year guidance.

## Product Development and Technological Advancements
TerraVolt has made significant strides in product development. The company showed progress on VOLTMAX prototypes with successful demonstrations in 2020, highlighting improved energy density and fire safety protocols. In 2021, their product roadmap was broadened, and discussions for Series funding advanced. The commercial launch of FlowCell X in 2022 marked a key milestone, enabling over 8 hours of grid support. The company also secured patent IP for its advanced flow chemistry. By 2022, TerraVolt's patent count reached 33.

## Market Expansion and Strategic Partnerships
The company has actively pursued market expansion and strategic partnerships. In 2021, TerraVolt signed its first utility pilot contract with a European energy major for pilot installations, validating its product in commercial settings. Future growth opportunities were identified with PG&E and European utilities in 2022. The significant PG&E contract in 2023 for grid storage capacity utilized a mix of solid-state and flow systems. Looking ahead, in February 2025, TerraVolt formed a strategic joint venture, the Green Technology Alliance, with EcoFlow Dynamics C010 and StratoSky Aerospace C015 to deliver integrated clean energy solutions.

## Operational Highlights and Risk Management
TerraVolt has faced and addressed operational challenges. Key risks identified in 2020 included safety testing and raw material dependencies. In early 2024, the company experienced supply chain shortages, specifically with cathode material, which delayed shipments. However, TerraVolt implemented mitigation strategies by exploring diversified suppliers and later securing long-term contracts with BASF and Umicore, restoring supply chain stability and production by September 2024.

## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Commitments
TerraVolt has demonstrated a commitment to ESG principles. In 2020, the company launched ESG initiatives focused on recycling and sustainable sourcing. This commitment was further expanded in 2024 with a new recycling plant initiative.
