## Company Overview and Founding

Borealis CloudWorks Oy was founded in Helsinki in September 2015 by Elsa Virtanen and Kai Lund. The company's initial focus was on providing green cloud solutions, leveraging Nordic energy sources.

## Financial Performance and Growth

Borealis CloudWorks has demonstrated consistent revenue growth over the years. In 2020, revenue was $82.1 million, a 22% increase year-over-year, driven by increased demand for cloud services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth continued into 2021 with revenue reaching $106 million (29% growth), and in 2022, revenue climbed to $137.2 million (also 29% growth). In 2023, revenue reached $140.5 million, showing slight growth despite some challenges in the third quarter. The company achieved 18% growth in 2024, with revenue reaching $165.9 million. Borealis CloudWorks has consistently maintained gross margins around 60.2% to 60.3%. Net income has also seen a positive trend, from $11.4 million in 2020 to $30.9 million in 2022, though it dipped to $23.5 million in 2023 before rising to $29.1 million in 2024. The company's cash reserves have also grown, from $10.7 million in 2020 to $15.7 million in 2024. Borealis CloudWorks has ambitious growth targets, forecasting $100 million in revenue for 2021, $130 million for 2022, and $200 million for 2025.

## Research and Development and Acquisitions

The company has invested significantly in Research and Development (R&D) to enhance its platform and offerings. R&D expenditure was $41.6 million in 2020, with 25% allocated to R&D. In 2021, R&D spending was $23.8 million, focused on hybrid platforms. This increased to $30.8 million in 2022 and $32.4 million in 2023, and $36.6 million in 2024. In 2021, Borealis CloudWorks acquired a networking startup for $6 million.

## Funding and Market Strategy

In July 2021, Borealis CloudWorks raised $55 million in Series A funding, which was used for platform scaling. The company has strategically competed with Nimbus MegaCloud through aggressive pricing and, in 2024, through a joint venture with Asteria (C002) to develop AI-cloud solutions and challenge Nimbus. The company also expanded into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region with a Singapore subsidiary in June 2024, anticipating a 20% revenue increase from this expansion.

## Risks and Scandals

Borealis CloudWorks has faced several risks and challenges. Energy volatility was identified as a key risk in 2020, though it was later mitigated. Competition from Nimbus MegaCloud has been a persistent factor. Data breaches were a concern in 2021, and regulatory scrutiny on benchmarks emerged in 2022. The company experienced a significant scandal in April 2024 when it was exposed for making fake uptime claims to gain an advantage over Nimbus MegaCloud, resulting in a $700,000 EU fine and an 8% revenue decline. This led to a pivot towards verified metrics. Ethics in marketing was also identified as a risk in 2023.

## Strategic Partnerships and Future Outlook

Borealis CloudWorks has been actively pursuing strategic partnerships. In 2024, early talks with C002 for AI-cloud development materialized into a joint venture with Asteria (C002) in February 2025. This collaboration aims to offer integrated AI-cloud solutions and challenge Nimbus, with a target of 25% growth and 10 new patents. The company also focuses on emerging technologies like edge compute. The board of directors consists of 8 members, with 65% independence. The company also outlines its tax strategies in its filings. Borealis CloudWorks is committed to sustainability metrics, which are included in its full financial statements.
