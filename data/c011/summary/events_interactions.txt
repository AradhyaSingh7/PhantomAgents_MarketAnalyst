In October 2022, their Quantum Software Simulator received certification aligned with FDA requirements, enabling its use in clinical research and opening access to the US clinical market. Looking ahead, in August 2025, C011 submitted its designed compliance documents for EU quantum standards, aiming for faster market approvals within the European Union.

## Partnerships and Collaborations

The company has actively pursued strategic partnerships and collaborations. In August 2023, C011 entered into a partnership with National Labs for quantum computational chemistry projects, extending research cooperation and securing government funding, which is expected to drive pipeline growth and enhance prestige. Further strengthening its offerings, C011 partnered with Cobalt CyberGuard in January 2024 for quantum-safe security integration, enhancing its portfolio with post-quantum cryptography solutions. In July 2025, C011 deepened its collaboration with Intel Quantum, expanding their partnership for quantum hardware development and gaining access to manufacturing capabilities. A significant strategic move was the announcement in February 2025 of the Tri-Forge JV Launch, a joint venture with C003 and C005, aimed at integrating Borealis and QuantumQuill capabilities for cross-sector research and development and sales synergy.

## Intellectual Property and Technological Advancements

C011 has consistently focused on strengthening its intellectual property and technological capabilities. In March 2021, they were granted a core hardware patent for their superconducting qubit architecture by the USPTO, bolstering their competitive advantage. The company has continued to file patents, including 5 patents in May 2025 enhancing qubit error correction circuits, and a comprehensive filing of 8 patents in December 2024 covering quantum error correction and control, thereby expanding its intellectual property protection. A major technological achievement was reached in August 2024, with the milestone of achieving stable 100-qubit quantum processor operation, demonstrating industry leadership.

## Financial Performance and Funding

C011 has experienced strong financial growth and secured crucial funding. In August 2020, they were awarded a $3M research grant from the Department of Energy for quantum algorithm development, securing R&D funding. The company successfully closed a Series B funding round in February 2023, raising $35M in growth capital from quantum-focused investors, which is accelerating development. C011 reported an earnings beat in Q2 2025, demonstrating revenue and EPS growth that surpassed expectations, leading to positive stock momentum. They further reinforced investor confidence with an earnings call and guidance in August 2025, highlighting strong results and optimistic future projections. The company also achieved a significant financial milestone in August 2025, reaching an $80M annual revenue run-rate, validating its growth trajectory.

## Customer Wins and Market Expansion

C011 has secured notable customer wins and expanded its market reach. In December 2022, they secured a $2.8M contract with AeroSpace Tech for quantum simulation to optimize aircraft design. A significant commercial win occurred in April 2024 with PharmaGen, where expanded commercial orders for quantum computing solutions are expected to increase Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by $5M, supporting clinical AI for pharma R&D. C011 has also pursued international expansion, establishing a Munich office in January 2022 for the EU quantum market and a Singapore office in January 2025 for the APAC market, reflecting a regional growth strategy.

## Research and Recognition

C011 has been recognized for its contributions to quantum computing research and development. In July 2021, the company significantly enhanced its R&D capabilities by hiring 45 quantum engineers and physicists. Their work was further validated through a keynote presentation by the CEO at the Quantum Computing Summit in May 2022, positioning them as an industry leader. C011 received a quantum innovation award from MIT in December 2023 for their breakthrough contributions. In March 2025, they published breakthrough research on quantum computational advantage in Nature, enhancing their scientific credibility. C011 was also recognized as a market leader in the quantum industry in August 2025, validating their market positioning.

## Other Notable Events

C011 secured an $8M DARPA contract in April 2025 for quantum defense applications, diversifying their government revenue. In October 2024, they achieved a successful deployment with Helix Data for data analytics optimization, providing proof of commercial viability.
