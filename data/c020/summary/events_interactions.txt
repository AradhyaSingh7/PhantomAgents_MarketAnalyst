## Product Demonstration

On May 22, 2020, C020 conducted a significant product demonstration, showcasing the first cell-based lettuce production in vertical farms. This event, a product-related demonstration, garnered global media attention.

## Licensing Agreement and Regulatory Milestone

C020 entered into a licensing agreement with Nestl√© on November 4, 2021. This agreement involved licensing plant-cell technology for the production of nutraceutical actives, which established the company's first recurring royalty stream. Subsequently, on August 13, 2022, C020 achieved a major regulatory milestone when the FDA granted "GRAS" (Generally Recognized As Safe) status for its Nutrivine additive, a cell wine additive. This regulatory approval was crucial for enabling the commercialization of the product in the United States.

## Strategic Partnership and Operational Challenges

On September 19, 2023, C020 formed a strategic partnership with Coca-Cola to supply cell-derived phytonutrients for beverage fortification. This partnership is estimated to be a multi-year deal worth $20 million, contributing to revenue. However, the company faced operational challenges related to high energy prices, as indicated by an event on March 6, 2024. This energy inflation put pressure on the operating margins of its indoor farms.

## Resolution of Operational Challenges and Joint Venture

To address the energy cost volatility, C020 signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a solar farm on October 11, 2024. This resolution stabilized the company's cost base. Looking ahead, on February 10, 2025, C020 is set to form a joint venture with Bayer. This agri-biotech joint venture aims to expand the precision trait platform, thereby broadening the company's pipeline and opening new revenue streams.

## Financial Performance

The company reported record revenue for Q2 on August 19, 2025, driven by strong performance in licensing and produce sales. This financial achievement is expected to result in stock appreciation.
