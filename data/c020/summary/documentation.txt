## Company Performance and Revenue Growth##
BioHarvest has demonstrated consistent revenue growth from 2020 to 2024. In 2020, the company reported $16.8 million in revenue from early produce sales. This figure more than doubled to $34.1 million in 2021, and further increased to $62.4 million in 2022. The growth continued to $94.8 million in 2023 and reached $119.2 million in 2024. A Q2 2025 earnings release reported record revenues of $21.8 million, driven by partnerships with Nestlé and Coca-Cola, with a positive earnings per share of $0.49 and raised full-year guidance.

## Technological Demonstrations and Commercialization##
BioHarvest's innovative PhytoCell technology was showcased with the demonstration of its first edible leafy crop, PhytoCell lettuce, in a vertical farm setting in May 2020. This demonstration garnered significant media and investor attention worldwide. In 2022, the company achieved a major milestone with the FDA granting Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) approval for its Nutrivine additive, a cell-grown wine enhancer, which opened up commercial sales opportunities in the United States.

## Strategic Partnerships and Licensing Agreements##
The company has strategically expanded its business model towards intellectual property licensing and has secured key partnerships. In November 2021, BioHarvest signed a licensing agreement with Nestlé, granting them rights to use PhytoCell actives in nutraceutical markets, which provides annual royalty streams and milestone payments. A significant multi-year agreement was established with Coca-Cola in September 2023 to supply cell-derived phytonutrients for their wellness beverages, with an initial deal value of $20 million. Furthermore, a joint venture with Bayer CropScience was announced in February 2025 to advance precision traits and the cell-agriculture platform, anticipating future licensing and product collaborations.

## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Initiatives##
BioHarvest has actively pursued ESG initiatives across its operations. These include piloting a water recycling program in 2020, establishing rural farming empowerment programs in 2021, and expanding solar energy usage in vertical farming in 2022. The company also made a zero-deforestation pledge in 2023. In 2024, BioHarvest achieved its ESG goal of 50% equal gender hiring.

## Operational Risks and Mitigation Strategies##
The company has faced and is managing several operational risks. Initial risks identified in 2020 included scalability and energy costs. In March 2024, high electricity prices impacted vertical farm margins by 200 basis points. To mitigate these energy cost pressures and stabilize future exposures, BioHarvest accelerated the signing of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy. In October 2024, the company contracted with multiple solar suppliers in Israel, Spain, and the US to secure long-term energy cost stability. Future risks identified in 2023 and 2024 include the adoption rate of novel foods and volatility in energy and food regulation.
