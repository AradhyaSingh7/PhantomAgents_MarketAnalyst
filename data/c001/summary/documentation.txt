## Company Founding and Early Years

Helios Mobility Systems Inc. was incorporated in 2012 in San Jose by Maya Chen and Arun Patel. The company's initial focus was on leveraging lab research related to EV batteries, developing prototype modules for local startups. This early stage was supported by $3.2 million in seed funding, which enabled the company to make its first hires.

## Navigating Global Disruptions and Growth

The company experienced a challenging year in 2020, with revenue declining by 8% to $121.1 million due to supply chain interruptions caused by COVID-19. Gross margins compressed to 26.7%, and the company reported a net loss of $5.1 million. Cash reserves ended the year at $9.2 million, though liquidity lines provided support. In response to the pandemic's impact, Helios pivoted to dual-sourcing strategies and remote work, building more resilient inventory systems.

A significant leadership change occurred in early 2021 when Maya Chen was promoted from COO to CEO. This transition coincided with a strong recovery year, with revenue jumping 40% to $169.4 million. Gross margins improved to 29.2%, and the company achieved positive operating income and net income. This growth was supported by $85 million in Series C funding, which was allocated to expanding operations into the EU with a new subsidiary and investing further in research and development.

## Product Innovation and Market Expansion

Helios launched its VoltEdge S95, a high-density module, in 2022, which was adopted by three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This product launch drove a 43% increase in revenue, reaching $241.9 million for the year. Gross margins further improved to 30.1%. In the same year, the company acquired a firmware vendor for $9.8 million and expanded its R&D focus to anomaly detection technology.

In 2023, Helios continued its growth trajectory, with revenue reaching $282.1 million, a 17% increase. The company invested $18.2 million in R&D, focusing on embedded vision technology. A key development was the FluxGrid BMS upgrade, which incorporated an analytics suite and pilots demonstrated a 12% reduction in defects, leading to a $50 million backlog. The company also saw its board composition stabilize with 7 members, 57% of whom were independent.

The company's innovation continued in 2024 with the launch of FluxGrid v2, integrating embedded vision capabilities through a collaboration with Asteria. This upgrade demonstrated 18% efficiency gains in pilots and secured 12 new customers. Helios also entered into a joint venture with Asteria for joint R&D, aiming to gain a significant market share through integrated technology.

## Financial Performance and Outlook

Throughout these years, Helios has generally shown an upward trend in revenue and profitability, with some fluctuations. For instance, 2020 was a difficult year with revenue of $121.1 million and a net loss, while 2021 saw a strong rebound with revenue of $169.4 million and net income. By 2022, revenue grew to $241.9 million with a net income of $19.1 million. The company projected revenue of $320-340 million for 2024 and anticipated further growth in 2025 with the implementation of a traceability program.

## Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Helios has consistently identified supply chain volatility, particularly concentration in China, and competition from Asian manufacturers as key risks. The company has actively worked to mitigate these risks through strategies such as dual-sourcing, building resilient inventory systems, and implementing QR traceability programs. Other identified risks include regulatory changes in EV standards, intellectual property disputes, potential recalls, geopolitical trade tensions, and counterfeit threats. The company also faced antitrust probes and counterfeit threats in later years, leading to a recall event that incurred a $1.35 million cost but was managed to prevent greater financial damage.

## ESG and Corporate Governance

The company has shown a commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Reports highlight efforts in sustainable materials, renewable energy adoption (25% by 2023), and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) metrics, with 35% women in management by 2023. An ESG audit was also completed in 2024, indicating a focus on transparency and accountability in these areas. The company also maintains a focus on research and development, with investments in areas like thermal mitigation, anomaly detection, and embedded vision technologies, aiming for improved efficiency and defect reduction.
