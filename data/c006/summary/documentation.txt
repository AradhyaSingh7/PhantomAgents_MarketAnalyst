##Risk Mitigation and Operational Focus##
Luminara has proactively addressed various risks and challenges. These include supply constraints for depth sensors, which were managed through allocation programs and renegotiated supplier agreements. The company has also focused on safety and reliability, emphasizing ISO-driven safety processes, repairable hardware designs, and privacy-friendly on-device processing. They have also implemented robust policies for review integrity and moderation following a marketing vendor scandal and addressed controversies regarding demo authenticity by releasing raw data and commissioning independent lab tests.

##Customer Impact and Use Cases##
The company's solutions have demonstrably impacted customer operations. Case studies highlight significant rework reduction and safety incident avoidance in assembly lines (TechForge), reduced missed steps and increased audit readiness in airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) (SkyBridge), and faster skill acquisition with fewer incidents in clinical training (Medisafe). EU worker-safety mapping has also been published to aid procurement teams in assessing compliance.
