## Product Demonstrations and Launches##

On September 19, 2020, C021 demonstrated its new low-energy desal membrane at a Dubai utility conference, resulting in pilot MOU commitments. Subsequently, on November 18, 2022, C021 launched its first solar-powered seawater desalination facility, a move that disrupted the market.

## Contract Wins and Revenue Generation##

C021 secured a significant 20-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) public-private partnership (PPP) for water supply in Kenya on August 24, 2021, ensuring long-term utility revenue. This was further bolstered by a major infrastructure project win on June 12, 2023, a 25-year BOT contract with the Kenya Water Utility, projected to generate over $300 million in lifecycle revenue.

## Risk and Resolution##

On March 3, 2024, C021 faced environmental concerns regarding brine effluent management, leading to a temporary project review. However, on September 7, 2024, C021 introduced a zero-brine circular solution that reuses treated brine for mineral recovery, successfully clearing regulatory compliance.

## Strategic Partnerships and Financial Performance##

On February 10, 2025, C021 formed the Global Water Alliance JV with Veolia and Doosan, global water giants, to pursue mega projects and expand its BOT pipeline. This strategic move was followed by strong financial performance, with C021 reporting record H1 2025 revenues and bookings on August 19, 2025, which led to stock gains.
