## Company Performance and Growth

AquaPure Desalination has demonstrated significant revenue growth over the years. In FY 2020, the company reported $32M in revenue, driven by the successful NeoMem low-energy membrane demonstrations. This grew to $54M in FY 2021, boosted by the company's first Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) contract in Africa, which also significantly increased its backlog. Revenue further climbed to $92M in FY 2022, supported by the commercial launch of the SunDesal solar plant. By FY 2023, revenue reached $128M, with the signing of a 25-year BOT project in Kenya. The company continued its upward trajectory, reporting $174M in revenue for FY 2024. In the first half of 2025, revenue exceeded $45M, with the order book backlog doubling and financial guidance for the fiscal year being raised by 15%.

## Technological Advancements and Product Launches

Key to AquaPure's success has been its technological innovation. A September 2020 document highlighted the NeoMem membranes, showcased at a Dubai event, which reduced energy consumption per cubic meter by 25%, leading to utilities signing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). In November 2022, the company inaugurated its first solar-driven Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) plant, SunDesal, capable of producing 50,000 cubic meters per day and reducing the carbon footprint by 60%. The company's patent portfolio expanded to 30 by 2022.

## Key Contracts and Partnerships

AquaPure has secured significant contracts and formed strategic partnerships. In August 2021, a 20-year BOT PPP contract was signed with Nairobi Water Utility for a capacity of 30 million cubic meters per year. This was followed by a major 25-year, $300M BOT contract signed with Kenya Water Utility in June 2023, with financing syndicated by the African Development Bank. Looking ahead, a Joint Venture named Global Water Alliance was established in February 2025 with Veolia and Doosan to pursue mega desalination projects exceeding $1 billion, establishing a global PPP platform.

## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Initiatives

The company has a strong focus on ESG. In 2020, a solar integration roadmap was published. By 2021, a migrant worker equity policy was launched. A significant development in 2023 was the initiation of a circular water recovery program. The company faced an environmental challenge in March 2024 when NGOs flagged elevated salinity near a MENA pilot site, leading to a temporary pause in permits by regulators. However, by September 2024, AquaPure had engineered a resolution with a zero-brine solution, recycling 95% of brine into industrial salts and minerals, which led to regulatory compliance being cleared. The company achieved water-neutral operations by February 2025, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices.

## Identified Risks and Challenges

AquaPure has faced potential risks and challenges throughout its operations. Initially, in FY 2020, the company noted risks associated with high energy dependency and geopolitical contracting hurdles. More recently, a brine disposal controversy began rising in FY 2023. This culminated in a brine disposal incident in FY 2024, which temporarily tarnished the company's reputation, although it was subsequently resolved with the zero-brine solution.
